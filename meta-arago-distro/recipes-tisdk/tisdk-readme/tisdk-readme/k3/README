The files contained in this directory represent the images that were built
as part of the original SDK build and packaging process.  They are meant
to serve as a restore and starting point for your development.  In order
to use these images with an SD card they should be placed in the appropriate
locations.

By default these locations are:

+-------------+-----------------------------------------+
|    File     |                Location                 |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------+
| tiboot3.bin | boot partition                          |
| tispl.bin   | boot partition                          |
| u-boot.img  | boot partition                          |
| sysfw.itb   | boot partition                          |
| uEnv.txt    | boot partition                          |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Image       | /boot directory of the rootfs partition |
| *.dtb       | /boot directory of the rootfs partition |
| *.dtbo      | /boot directory of the rootfs partition |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------+

By default the boot loaders are read from the first FAT partition, which is
usually called the "boot" partition.  Then the bootloader will look for the
Image and .dtb .dtbo files in the /boot directory of the ext4 partition, which is
usually called the "rootfs" partition.
